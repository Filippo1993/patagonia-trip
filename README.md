During the trip weather was fun, so I grabbed meteo data of those days from <a href="https://open-meteo.com" target="_blank">Open meteo </a> to quantify how much fun I had.

The bike took me a full month with 20 days of actual biking. During those days, while I was mostly going north, the wind was mostly going south-east, anyway, biking was fun!
