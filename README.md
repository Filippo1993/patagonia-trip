Repository of my solo bike trip of the Carretera Austral,<br>
it connects the Chilean regions of Ays√©n and Los Lagos.<br>
The Carretera starts from Villa O'Higgins and ends in Puerto Montt, <br>
but I started a little more south, from El Chalten.<br>
<br>
On the right is the gpx track of my bike adventure,<br>
in total 1.240 km with a positive gain of 18.500 m.<br>

During the trip weather was fun, so I grabbed meteo data of those days form <a href="https://open-meteo.com" target="_blank">Open meteo </a> to quantify how much fun I had.
